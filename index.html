                            Effective communication and organization are imperative for success and efficiency among student organizations. 
                            Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) often face challenges in coordinating meetings, sharing updates, and 
                            collaborating with members in a centralized and unified platform. Currently, many organizations use Slack for 
                            communication purposes, but it lacks specialized features tailored to the needs of these RSOs. The gap in 
                            functionality hinders efficient management and communication within student organizations.

                            Some previous attempts to address this issue have involved utilizing generic communication tools like Slack 
                            or GroupMe. While these platforms offer basic messaging capabilities and media uploads, they lack integration 
                            with organizational features such as event scheduling, task management, and member engagement tracking. 
                            This often causes RSO leaders and members to use multiple platforms to manage various aspects of their 
                            organization, which can cause difficulty in efficient communication. By addressing these issues and 
                            providing a dedicated platform designed specifically for RSO management, we can streamline organizational 
                            tasks, improve communication, and enhance internal and external communication. This project aims to 
                            leverage features and tools from existing technologies while implementing tailored solutions to meet 
                            the unique needs of RSOs, empowering student leaders to run their organizations in an effective 
                            and efficient manner.
