                            Effective communication and organization are imperative for success and efficiency among student organizations. 
                            Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) often face challenges in coordinating meetings, sharing updates, and 
                            collaborating with members in a centralized and unified platform. Currently, many organizations use <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> for 
                            communication purposes, but it lacks specialized features tailored to the needs of these RSOs. The gap in 
                            functionality hinders efficient management and communication within student organizations. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some previous attempts to address this issue have involved utilizing generic communication tools like <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> 
                            or <a href="https://groupme.com/en-US/">GroupMe</a>. While these platforms offer basic messaging capabilities and media uploads, they lack integration 
                            with organizational features such as event scheduling, task management, and member engagement tracking. 
                            This often causes RSO leaders and members to use multiple platforms to manage various aspects of their 
                            organization, which can cause difficulty in efficient communication. By addressing these issues and 
                            providing a dedicated platform designed specifically for RSO management, we can streamline organizational 
                            tasks, improve communication, and enhance internal and external communication. This project aims to 
                            leverage features and tools from existing technologies while implementing tailored solutions to meet 
                            the unique needs of RSOs, empowering student leaders to run their organizations in an effective 
                            and efficient manner.

                            This application targets students at universities who are part of Registered Student Organizations (RSOs).
                            RSOs do not receive as much recognition, and therefore resources and funding from the University, in comparison
                            to sports teams, which is a sentiment supported by a study done by Forbes 
                            (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2024/01/13/power-five-universities-spend-much-more-per-athlete-than-for-

                            Finds New Study</a>). This would allow minority groups to receive management resources to better support their progression
                            and achievements as RSOs, who work toward promoting student involvement in extracurricular activities.

                        <p>
                            This application aims to consolidate management and communication features that many university RSOs require 
                            to keep their organizations running. Firstly, the application includes a scheduling feature through which RSO 
                            members may input their availability, and the application will visualize the timings through which members can 
                            meet. This feature goes hand-in-hand with a calendar feature, where users can view a weekly/monthly calendar to 
                            see when meetings are scheduled. This calendar also provides reminders for members, where they will receive 
                            reminders prior to meetings and when meetings are scheduled. Additionally, the platform can connect to university 
                            services, where users can utilize a booking feature to book and reserve rooms. These reservations can be added to 
                            the calendar for scheduled meetings. The platform also contains a messaging feature, where members may communicate 
                            internally with other members within the organization (whether via direct messages, group chats, or specific channels). 
                            The messaging feature also allows users to communicate externally with other RSOs within the university to promote 
                            cross-communication throughout the university. The reminder feature is also applied to the messaging feature, where 
                            users are reminded if they have any unread messages. In order to mitigate potential harassment or trolling on the web 
                            application, we are implementing a report feature to allow users to report any harmful messages that may be sent through 
                            channels. Additionally, this issue is likely overall prevented by two-factor authentication, which is required to join 
                            an RSO on the platform. In sum, the two main features of the application are the calendar/scheduling feature and the 
                            messaging feature, and the subfeatures include reminders, room reservations, 2-FA, and the ability to report messages. 
                            Users will view scheduling and calendar information (date, time, and location data) and messages through communication 
                            features. We currently do not intend to use data from any external sources.

                        <h2>Solution Impact</h2>
                        <p>
                            This app addresses the inherent challenges faced by RSOs by providing a centralized platform with tailored features, which 
                            streamlines the management process, enhances communication efficiency, and fosters internal and external collaboration. The 
                            implementation of key features such as the scheduling feature allows RSOs to coordinate meetings and events, eliminating 
                            the need for manual scheduling and ultimately reducing logistical confusion. The messaging feature facilitates internal 
                            communication within RSOs such that leaders are able to reach out to members of their team or organizations to communicate 
                            important information. It also facilitates communication with other RSOs for collaborative purposes. Lastly, the reminder 
                            feature ensures that members stay informed and engaged by sending automated reminders for scheduled meetings or events, as 
                            well as reminders on unread messages. This solution directly tackles the inefficiencies caused by relying on multiple platforms 
                            for different organizational tasks. It also ensures accessibility to all RSOs, including those representing minority groups, for 
                            equal access to essential management resources. This fosters inclusivity and empowers all student organizations with tools to 
                            succeed. The practical impact of this system ultimately lies in its ability to support the growth of RSOs, contributing to a more 
                            engaged campus community.
